# Calling API using Java and Fetch Data
` We will use the Java standard library along with some additional libraries to make the API requests and handle the responses. `

### Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit(JDK) installed on your system.
* A text editor or an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.
* Basic understanding of Java programming language.

**STEP-1: Set up the Project**
1. Create a new Java project in your IDE.
1. Set up the project structure and create the necessary directories.
1. Add the required dependencies to your project.

**STEP-2: Make the API request**
1. Create a new Java class that will handle the API request.
1. Import the necessary classes and libraries at the top of your Java file.
1. Write a method to make the API request.
1. Customize the code to handle the response based on your API's requirements. You can parse the response JSON, extract data, or perform any other necessary operations.

**Step 3: Run the code**
1. Save the Java file.
2. Compile and run the Java class containing the API request code.
3. Verify that the API call is successful and that you are receiving the excepted response.

### Conclusion

> In this guide, we've covered the basic steps to call an API using Java. You can build upon this foundation to integrate APIs into your Java applications and handle various types of requests and responses.
